my solution is based on 2 arrays, one-dimensional question array and 2-dimensional answers array.
along with one objects array for scores.
the scores are calculated based on the questions and the answers.
for odd questions the points earned are different from the even, to make it harder to be compromised.
and the update for the scores is also scrambled and not on the sequential order, using nested switch case conditions.
in each switch case each answer is weighted differently, depending on the answer and to witch avenger it belongs and his location in the avengers array
